== JurySelect

JurySelect is a jury selection application for the Baltimore City Court System. Using the current process, all jurors are initially asked a series of questions, depending on the trial. The judge or a clerk is tasked with recording the numbers of the jurors who answer affrimatively to any of the questions. They achieve this by printing out a list with all the juror information and finding the appropriate juror when answers are made. The process can take hours, because finding the correct juror in the list takes time. 

With JurySelect, all of the searching and processing is done by the application. A judge or clerk simply initializes a new trial, populates it with questions, and enters the juror numbers as they are called for each question. When the judge or clerk is ready to review the answers, the application provides each juror with the questions that he or she responded to. In addition to the basic features, users can also save questions to use repeatedly, so that they don't have to enter them each time.
